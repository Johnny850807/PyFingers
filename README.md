# PyFingers

The 2P Finger Dance Dance Revolution music game in Python (QT) 

This project is one of my school project which is done in a hurry week, it still needs much improvement. See [TODO](#todo).
However, in the current version, you can already have some fun with creating your own music sheet and play it (with your friend, it's 2P).

        - Improve accuracy and performance
